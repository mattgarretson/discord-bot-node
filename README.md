# discord-bot-node
A simple Discord bot using discord.js

My first real attempt at ever using Node.js for anything. This bot started with 11 different commands users can use, and will likely grow to a much larger size in the future.

My hopes for this bot (named NodeBoi) is for it to be helpful bot, despite its mild to moderate sarcastic nature.
